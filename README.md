# pokedex
A vanilla JS pokedex. For educational purposes

I followed Justin Kims tutorial on youtube:

## Personal additions
I added some of my own functionality for educational purposes. I also fetch ability and moves info for every Pokemon from the API. 
This info is available by using the d-pad on the Pokedex.
